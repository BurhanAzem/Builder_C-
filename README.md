# One Hand - Backend Training

The goal of this project is to create a backend for conduit which is a [Medium](https://medium.com) clone.

The backend spec can be found [Here](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/backend-specs/introduction/).

For this project we will not be implementing any real authentication. Instead, we will simply rely on a header which will cover during the rest/postman parts.
